            <h2>Welcome to My Professional Portfolio</h2>
            <p>
                I am <strong>Subham Banerjee</strong>, an MSc student in <strong>Astrophysics</strong> at the <strong>Bonn-Cologne Graduate School of Physics and Astronomy</strong> (BCGS), University of Bonn. My academic and research journey is guided by a passion for unraveling the mysteries of the universe, particularly in the domains of <strong>gravitational waves</strong>, <strong>cosmic inflation</strong>, and <strong>radio astronomy</strong>. I have the privilege of working alongside some of the brightest minds at the <strong>Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy</strong> (MPIfR), where I am involved in cutting-edge research that seeks to push the boundaries of our understanding of the cosmos. I am especially interested in the study of <strong>primordial gravitational waves</strong> that originated during the early moments of the universe's inflationary period and their role in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe we observe today. Additionally, my work on <strong>NANOGrav</strong> allows me to investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background, which holds the potential to reveal new insights into the nature of spacetime and the fundamental forces that govern our universe.

            <p>
                Having started my academic path at <strong>St. Xavier’s College</strong>, Kolkata, where I earned a <strong>BSc in Physics (Honours)</strong>, I was exposed early on to the fascinating world of astrophysics and cosmology. This exposure was further deepened by my involvement in various research projects, internships, and observational astronomy work that laid the foundation for my current endeavors. From studying <strong>sunspot dynamics</strong> at the <strong>Father Eugene Lafont Observatory</strong> in Kolkata to contributing to the global <strong>NANOGrav</strong> collaboration, my research trajectory has been a blend of theoretical inquiry and hands-on observation. As I continue my studies at the University of Bonn and collaborate with the <strong>Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy</strong>, my goal is to contribute to the scientific community's understanding of the universe's most fundamental processes, from <strong>gravitational waves</strong> to the formation of large-scale cosmic structures. The research I am engaged in today not only builds on my previous work but also helps shape the future of <strong>radio astronomy</strong> and <strong>gravitational wave detection</strong>.

            <h2>Research Experience</h2>
            <h3>Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR) (2025-present)</h3>
            <p>As an intern at the MPIfR, I am currently involved in an exciting project that uses data from the MeerKAT radio telescope to study radio galaxies. This research aims to uncover key insights about the structure and evolution of galaxies by analyzing their radio emissions. MeerKAT, located in South Africa, is one of the most powerful radio telescopes in the world, and it provides an invaluable dataset for probing extragalactic objects. My work involves analyzing these data to understand the physical processes taking place in the cores of these galaxies, which may contribute to the broader understanding of active galactic nuclei (AGN), their formation, and their role in galaxy evolution. This research is closely tied to the ongoing efforts at MPIfR to map the large-scale structure of the universe and explore the nature of dark matter and dark energy.</p>

            <h3>Father Eugene Lafont Observatory, Kolkata, India (2023-2023)</h3>
            <p>At the Father Eugene Lafont Observatory, I worked on two significant observational projects. The first project focused on studying the growth and decay rates of sunspots, which involved detailed analysis using the observatory’s specialized solar telescope. This project helped me gain valuable experience in solar observations and the dynamics of stellar atmospheres. The second project involved the construction and operation of a high-frequency radio telescope using an Arduino platform for solar radio observations. This was a particularly enriching experience, as I had the opportunity to build a telescope from the ground up and observe the Sun’s radio emissions, contributing to the understanding of solar activity and its impact on space weather.</p>

            <h3>Space Science Education Research and Development (SSERD), Bangalore, India (2023)</h3>
            <p>During a short-term internship with SSERD, I conducted a comparative study on the mass accretion rates of high-mass and low-mass X-ray binaries. This research aimed to understand how different types of X-ray binaries evolve, with a focus on their accretion processes. The results of this study provided insights into the relationship between the mass of a stellar remnant and the rate at which matter is drawn toward it, affecting the binary system's luminosity and overall evolution.</p>

            <h3>St. Xavier’s College (2022-2023)</h3>
            <p>For my final-year dissertation, I conducted an in-depth study on cosmic inflation and its implications for the FRW universe. This research focused on theoretical models of the early universe and their impact on the formation of large-scale cosmic structures. Under the supervision of Dr. Suparna Roychowdhury, I worked on a range of theoretical tools and models to understand the inflationary period, including the dynamics of scalar fields and their contribution to the universe’s accelerated expansion.</p>
